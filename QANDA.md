## Q and A

After two interviews, I've determined three unforeseen features that the app may need.
Pending our stand up, we will determine whether we want to expand our scope.

##### Thomas
When asked, Thomas indicated he wanted these features for a dog walking app.
- Medicine : Daily Dog medications 
- Treats : Preferred treats
- Friendlyness : How friendly the clients dogs are to other dogs, cats, or humans.
- Disabilites : For dogs that can't go up stairs, etc.

"If I have someone taking care of my dogs, I want them to know this." 

Takeaway: It could be fruitful to provide "Dog Profiles" for individuals that need extra care. 
Profile API?

##### Fernando
When asked, Fernando indicated he wanted these features for a dog walking app.
- Walking (?)
- Grooming 
- Nutrition: How to provide proper nutritious food.

"Normally they want canned food but is it nutritious?"
"Nutrition would be the most important thing to me"

It is likely that Fernando's takeaways are outside the scope of this project, however we could provide links to several dog nutrition guides online. We can find references on wikipedia.

Takeaway: We could offer a seperate tab for Dog Sitters that only visit to feed dogs while the owner is busy.
